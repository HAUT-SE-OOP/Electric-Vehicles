### Electric vehicles database 

#### C++ program that allows users to use a database for electric vehicles. Project made for Silesian University of Technology.

Currently, this program let users:

- retrieve and show vehicles, and their data from a txt file,
- sort vehicles by chosen variable such as horsepower, mileage etc.
- add new vehicles to database,
- delete existing vehicles from database.


Program has a basic console GUI to make it easier for the users to use its functionality.
As this is a University project, I had to use getters and setters, which I wouldn't use otherwise.
